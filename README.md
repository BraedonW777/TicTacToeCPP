# TicTacToeCPP
- Basic game of Tic Tac Toe made in C++. 

I am a beginner and this is one of the first larger projects I have done. With this project I wanted to do my best to not use any tutorials or external help other than maybe searching for correct syntax. 

I am 100% sure that there are a million better ways I could of gone about doing this project. I know there are tons of things I should change to make this code better. I probably used quite a few bad practices. 

This was a learning exercise for me to make a project without following what someone else has done or trying to find solutions online.(maybe looking up syntax) 

With all that being said, I would still love for you to share "constructive criticism" about this code. All the things I could to do make this better or better practices to follow. After all I am just here to learn! 

Fell free to use or edit this code as you wish!

Please let me know what you think!
